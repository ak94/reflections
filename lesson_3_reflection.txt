When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
-
  When I wish to work from different machines, i.e. from office and at home.
  When I am working in a team.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
-
	to start working on a remote repo it good start with recent code , so pull it.
	but when you are finished your branch work then commit and push it.after that pull it again for getting changes by others.

	forks- clone remote repo of another user to your own github repositories.
	clone- makes copy of repo from github to local machine
